# Open-Ended-Skill-Discovery

Instead of optimizing for a fixed task, open-ended learning agents autonomously generate and solve new tasks to continually expand their repertoire of skills. This project studies algorithms for unsupervised goal generation and measures how well agents discover diverse, transferable behaviors over time.
